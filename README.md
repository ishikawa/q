# q

I'd like to learn about how transformers work in practice, including their architecture and applications in real-world scenarios. Therefore, I decided to create my own GPT model. First, I plan to learn from excellent articles and papers written by other people to understand basic concepts and its architecture. Gradually, I will build my own GPT model. Finally, I aim to use it in web application and games that interest me.
